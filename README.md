# DistanceValidator

This repository contains the files for a distancing/occupation validator, which quickly and accurately counts the number of people in a room and checks if they are adequately distanced. It does this using a two-tiered validation system that consists of a webcam feed and a LiDAR sensor. Check out the attached PDF report to learn more!
